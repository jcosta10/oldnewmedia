Silicon Valley’s elite workforce “is even younger, more masculine and more fully committed to working all hours,” while also creating productivity tools that are premised on a kind of ruthless, winner-takes-all race to maximal efficiency. This means that young, mostly male engineers, often unencumbered by time-consuming familial or community responsibilities, are building the tools that will police very different workplaces, quantifying the productivity and desirability of employees. The workaholism and round-the-clock hours often glorified by tech start-ups become an implicit benchmark against which other workers are measured, producing a vision of a standard worker that is masculinized, narrow, and reliant on the unpaid or underpaid care work of others."

Workers began suffering high stress, Injuries, and illness. Muse explained that if their rate went down three times they would be fired, no matter how long they had worked at the warehouse. Workers talked about having to skip bathroom breaks for fear that they would underperform." <span class="container-legend"><span class="legend">[2]<span class="legend-1">Crawford, Kate. 2021 Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence.
